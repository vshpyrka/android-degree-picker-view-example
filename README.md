This is the illustration of an Android custom view designed to serve as a temperature degree picker. 

The view is responsive to touch events occurring on the outer ring of the custom interface. 

It employs the Android SweepGradient to exhibit a gradient featuring multiple colors, and also utilizes the Android PorterDuffXfermode to present temperature bars.
